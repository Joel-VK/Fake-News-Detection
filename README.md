# Fake-News-Detection

## Overview
*Fake news is intentionally written to mislead readers to believe false information, which makes it difficult and nontrivial to detect based on news content.
*The extensive spread of fake news has the potential for extremely negative impacts on individuals and society.
*We investigate the text and image information from various perspectives, such as the computational linguistic, sentiment analysis.
*Previous studies on FakeNewsNet have used various machine learning techniques (SVM, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression) and deep learning models ( LSTM, Attention) to perform the fake news detection.
