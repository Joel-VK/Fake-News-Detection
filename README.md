# Fake-News-Detection

## Overview
-Fake news is intentionally written to mislead readers to believe false information, which makes it difficult and nontrivial to detect based on news content.
-The extensive spread of fake news has the potential for extremely negative impacts on individuals and society.
-We investigate the text and image information from various perspectives, such as the computational linguistic, sentiment analysis.
-Previous studies on FakeNewsNet have used various machine learning techniques (SVM, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression) and deep learning models ( LSTM, Attention) to perform the fake news detection.
-But they fail to perform well due to following reasons:
   -They lacked the contextual information present in the text and 
   -They do not capture the features from the image modality that may seek to emphasize certain facts.
-We have analyzed two models:
   -Event Adversarial Neural Network Architecture (EANN)
   -Multimodal Variational Autoencoder (MVAE)
- The model trained executed with 73% evaluation accuracy and classified news as fake and legit.
